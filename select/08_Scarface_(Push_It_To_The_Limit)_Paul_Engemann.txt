Push it to the limit
Walk along the razor's edge
But don't look down, just keep your head, or you'll be finished
Open up the limit
Past the point of no return
You've reached the top, but still you gotta learn how to keep it

Hit the wheel and double the stakes
Throttle wide open like a bat out of Hell
You crash the gates (crash the gates)
Going for the back of beyond
Nothing gonna stop you, there's nothing that strong
So close now, you're nearly at the brink
So, push it, ooh, yeah

Welcome to the limit (limit)
Take it, baby, one step more
The power game's still playing, so
You better win it

Push it to the limit (limit)
No one left to stand in your way
You might get careless, but you'll never be safe while you're still in it
Welcome to the limit (limit)
Standing on the razor's edge
Don't look down, just keep your head, or you'll be finished

Welcome to the limit (the limit, the limit, the limit, the limit)
Push it to the limit (the limit, the limit, the limit, the limit)
(The limit, the limit, the limit, the limit)
Push it to the limit (the limit, the limit, the limit, the limit)
(The limit, the limit, the limit...)
