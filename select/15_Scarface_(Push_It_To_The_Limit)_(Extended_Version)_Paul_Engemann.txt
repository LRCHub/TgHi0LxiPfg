Push it to the limit
Walk along the razor's edge
But don't look down
Just keep your head
Or you'll be finished

Open up the limit
Past the point of no return
Reached the top
But still you gotta learn how to keep it

Hit the wheel and double the stakes
Throttle wide open like a bat out of hell
You crash the gates
(Crash the gates)

Going for the back of beyond
Nothing gonna stop you
There's nothing that strong
So close, now you're nearly at the brink
So, push it, ooh yeah

Welcome to the limit (the limit)
Take it maybe one step more
The power game's still playing
So you better win it

Push it to the limit (the limit)
With no one left to stand in your way
You might get careless, but you'll never be safe
While you're still living

Welcome to the limit (the limit)
Standing on the razor's edge
Don't look down, just keep your head
Or you'll be finished

Welcome to the limit (the limit, the limit, the limit, the limit)
Push it to the limit (the limit, the limit, the limit, the limit)
(The limit, the limit, the limit, the limit)
Push it to the limit (the limit, the limit, the limit, the limit)
(The limit, the limit)
