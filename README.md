[00:18.73] Push it to the limit
[00:22.50] Walk along the razor's edge
[00:25.57] But don't look down, just keep your head
[00:28.25] And you'll be finished
[00:39.25] 
[00:34.22] Open up the limit
[00:38.20] Past the point of no return
[00:41.25] You've reached the top but still you gotta learn
[00:44.01] How to keep it
[00:51.01] 
[00:50.87] Hit the wheel and double the stakes
[00:53.81] Throttle wide open like a bat out of hell
[00:56.56] And you crash the gates
[01:00.18] (crash the gates)
[01:08.68] 
[01:03.39] Going for the back of beyond
[01:06.47] Nothing gonna stop you
[01:07.60] There's nothing that strong
[01:09.44] So close now you're nearly at the brink
[01:12.21] So, push it
[01:17.71] 
[01:14.51] (Ooo yeah)
[01:19.51] 
[01:27.58] Welcome to the limit
[01:29.80] (The limit)
[01:31.55] Take it maybe one step more
[01:34.55] The power game's still playing so
[01:37.05] You better win it
[01:45.55] 
[02:02.05] Push it to the limit
[02:04.28] (The limit)
[02:05.92] With no one left to stand in your way
[02:09.02] You might get careless, but you'll never be safe
[02:11.53] While you still feel it
[02:23.03] 
[02:17.78] Welcome to the limit
[02:19.93] (The limit)
[02:21.60] Standing on the razor's edge
[02:24.82] Don't look down just keep your head
[02:27.43] And you'll be finished
[02:38.43] 
[02:33.38] Welcome to the limit
[02:34.77] (The limit)
[02:35.65] (The limit)
[02:36.39] (The limit)
[02:37.33] (The limit)
[02:42.83] 
[02:39.57] Push it to the limit
[02:41.16] (The limit)
[02:41.85] (The limit)
[02:42.83] (The limit)
[02:43.65] (The limit)
[02:49.15] 
[02:47.74] (The limit)
[02:49.10] (The limit)
[02:49.86] (The limit)
[02:50.57] (The limit)
[02:56.07] 
[02:52.11] Push it to the limit
[02:53.68] (The limit)
[02:54.55] (The limit)
[02:55.31] (The limit)
[02:56.13] (The limit)
